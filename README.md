# CAAI Data Task - Marco Gutierrez
Here, you'll find a jupyter notebook with the answers to the data task

In order to run this code, you require the metadata of the databases, which can be found [here](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/static/imdb_meta.tar)

It wasn't uploaded to the repo as its purpose is only to store code, not databases
