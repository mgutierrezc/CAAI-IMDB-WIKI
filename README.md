# CAAI Data Task - Marco Gutierrez
Here, you'll find a jupyter notebook with the answers to the data task

In order to run this code, you require the metadata of the databases, which I've uploaded to this [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dg-T8gAxzBX8lGuYc-w_zB-Mqu2nC1t_?usp=sharing)

It wasn't uploaded to the repo as its purpose is only to store code, not databases
